 Simple tools to have a look on time
## try it
You can [try it](https://cedricrey.github.io/timeKeepr/)

## How it works
By default, there is a default frame on the page. You can edit it with the "edit" Icon, save it on local web browser, load saved frame and share this frame by sending the url.

When everything is ready, just push the play button to launch the stopwatch and see how mush time left for your current task.
When the current task is done, the next one takes over and so on until the end of the frame
